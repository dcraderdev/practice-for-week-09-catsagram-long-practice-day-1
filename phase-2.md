First, add a button that requests and displays a new cat image, replacing the original image.

Second, for the active image, allow the user to upvote/downvote the image and display the score (upvotes - downvotes).

Third, allow the user to add comments to the image. You want to access the value of the comment input field and append a new element representing the comment.

Whenever a new image is requested, the upvotes and comments should be reset.

The final product should at the very least match wireframes/phase-2.png. If you finish early, try to implement a delete comment feature!

By this point, your code could be getting a little bit messy within index.js. Try DRYing up your code and keep in mind the Single Responsibility Principle.
